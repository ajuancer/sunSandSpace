# SunSandSpace

![SunSandSpace icon](www.github.io/ajuancer/sunSandSpace/master/docs/resources/img/logo_v1.png)**SunSandSpace** is a [Telegram](www.telegram.org) bot that checks the Gijón beaches occupation, making easier choose the perfect place for maintaining social distancing, one measure suggested[^fn1] to reduce the spread of COVID-19[^fn2].

The project contains these files:

- [`main.py`](www.github.com/ajuancer/master/main.py): File containing almost all the program.
- [`img`](www.github.com/ajuancer/master/img): Dir with the needed images. They are beaches maps obtained from [OpenStreetMap](www.openstreetmap.org).
- [`info.json`](www.github.com/ajuancer/sunSandSpace/master/info.json): JSON file containing the limit coords for each image in the `/img` dir. This is a _temp patch_ to cover some missing info of the official API. 

## I want to use it!

A preview of the bot is available at the [official page](ajuancer.github.io/sunSandSpace).
